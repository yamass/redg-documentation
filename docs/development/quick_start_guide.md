This is a quick start guide for the development of RedG. If you want to use RedG in your project, see [here](../getting_started.md).

!!! info
    If you require a feature, either open an issue and hope it might get implemented or feel free to 
    fork our repository, implement it yourself and create a pull request.
    
## Project setup

Clone the Git-Repository (`git@github.com:yamass/redg.git` or your HTTPS link). RedG uses Maven 
for development and you can simply import the main `pom.xml` in your favorite IDE.

The main project has 6 sub-projects:

| Module | Content |
| ------ | ------- |
| `redg-extractor` | Library for generating RedG entity definition code from existing entities in a database. Can be used for migrating to RedG |
| `redg-generator` | Analyzes the database schema and generates the matching entity classes. Search here if you want to extend or have trouble with the generated code |
| `redg-jpa-providers` | A name and datatype provider for usage with the `redg-generator`, that uses information from your JPA Metamodel. Not included by default because of Hibernate dependency |
| `redg-maven-plugin` | The plugin that integrates the `redg-generator` into the Maven build process |
| `redg-models` | Common model files |
| `redg-runtime` | The runtime needed during execution. Search here, if the generated code is fine but execution fails during runtime or you want more features |
